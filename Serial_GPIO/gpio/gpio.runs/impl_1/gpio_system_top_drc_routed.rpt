2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg/L3_2/O, cell system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg/L3_2 (in system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/rxParityCheck__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/rxParityCheck_reg_i_2/O, cell system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/rxParityCheck_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port GPIO[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port GPIO[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port GPIO[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port GPIO[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
