HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) GPIO[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (GPIO[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) GPIO[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (GPIO[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) GPIO[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (GPIO[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) system/system_i/serial_0/inst/serial_v1_0_AXI_inst/myReceiver/determinedBit_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
